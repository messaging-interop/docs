# Interoperability

People use diverse software and services, and it is important to allow people make independent choices about the software agents they use to send and receive messages - just as they do with email and telephony. The key points of interoperability in this architecture are:
* Between client software that encrypt and decrypt messages under this architecture and maintain syncronized proton state.
* Between Sending and Receiving agents to transmit ciphertexts for message content and address
* Between client software and Sending and Receiving Agents
	* Sending and Receiving agents must be interchangeable
